package-techniclauncher
=======================

Package TechnicLauncher and Java in a nice deb or rpm.

I can’t host this package because it contains Oracles Java, but you can build it your self inside a nice Docker container to get deb and rpm’s.

I build this for my self, but share the Dockerfile's for you to use.

If you can’t figure out how to use this, this is probably not for you.
